# Author's notes

This code is mostly undocumented.
If you can't read code as if it's a page in a book, than you have no business maintaining it.
Good luck.




# Attention Deficit oH Dear

// V.0.1.2.1.3 // Mid-Test Release 2.1 //       

// V.0.1.2.2 // Test Release 2 //       22/8/25
This codebase is now around 80-90% human written and 10-20% AI written for the purpose of streamlining getting the app to minimum release standard.

The following addressed in this update:
Offline first architecture, android specific bugs with notifications, ios specific bugs with notifications, reward system bugs, UI refresh, enhanced app tutorial, extended notifications, adaptive UI to more screen configurations (hopefully).


// V.0.1.2.1 // Test Release 1 //         10/8/25
MVP features ready for clinical trials.
Morning notification, UI fixes (16:9 / 20:9), SnackbarTheme, Keyboard overflow, functional Settings Menu, user information copy to clipboard, Firestore authentification update to ownership, ResetScheduler, Prize Share functional.

// v.0.1.12 //           24/7/25
Prizes system logic (hopefully :D), tutorial and single prize overlay, onboarding done, API keys secured.
Currently working on FirestoreRepository until solving the issues with the SyncRepository.
Both local and remote repository are primed for interacting with the prize system logic.

// v.0.1.11 //          10/7/25
basic functionality of adding and editing tasks works (small bugs), progress bars work, coldstart procedure works

// v.0.1   //           18/5/2025
most HiFi screens programmed in, no function.





# Acknowledgments
ðŸ¤– Co-developed with the assistance of Miranda (ChatGPT-4o), whose structured logic and tireless debugging helped shape this codebase, patiently debugged the overlay ghosts, handled sync chaos between SharedPreferences and Firestore, and helped architect a focused, efficient sprinting experience.
T.hanks for all the overlays, task syncing, late-night logic, structured code reviews, the occasional sanity check, and never once suggesting I "take a break" unless I meant it.
Code hard, commit clean, and may all your overlays stay where they belong
