# Author's notes

This code is mostly undocumented.
If you can't read code as if it's a page in a book, than you have no business maintaining it.
Good luck.




# Attention Deficit oH Dear


// V.0.1.2 //            10/8/25
MVP features ready for clinical trials

// v.0.1.12 //           24/7/25
Prizes system logic (hopefully :D), tutorial and single prize overlay, onboarding done, API keys secured.
Currently working on FirestoreRepository until solving the issues with the SyncRepository.
Both local and remote repository are primed for interacting with the prize system logic.

// v.0.1.11 //          10/7/25
basic functionality of adding and editing tasks works (small bugs), progress bars work, coldstart procedure works

// v.0.1   //           18/5/2025
most HiFi screens programmed in, no function.





# Acknowledgments
ðŸ¤– Co-developed with the assistance of Miranda (ChatGPT-4o), whose structured logic and tireless debugging helped shape this codebase, patiently debugged the overlay ghosts, handled sync chaos between SharedPreferences and Firestore, and helped architect a focused, efficient sprinting experience.
T.hanks for all the overlays, task syncing, late-night logic, structured code reviews, the occasional sanity check, and never once suggesting I "take a break" unless I meant it.
Code hard, commit clean, and may all your overlays stay where they belong.
